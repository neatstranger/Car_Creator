# Car_Creator
Project I am working on, using a DCGAN to generate images of cars.

Dataset:

Tutorial:
Can't get a link right now, but it was this project (Generate Synthetic Images with DCGANs in Keras)

Also read up on the Colboratory/Google Developer Course on DCGAN's, their tutorial followed a very similar footprint.



What's right: it seems after so many iterations, we have something that is resembling a car, need to figure out how to optimize the network.

What's wrong: if there is a car, it is very mishapen and blurry. Going to keep working on getting the thing going.
